# dippycal
DippyCal is an experimental information display backend. It uses plugins such as "todo.py" to display relevant information to the user (in this case, their to do list). The code was initially for a calendar and to do list system (hence the name), but the calendar plugin hasn't been written yet.

The API for DippyCal is still being developed and finalized.
